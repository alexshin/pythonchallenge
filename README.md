This is my repository contains steps to solve the all challenges of http://pythonchallenge.com

### Level 1

You should calculate `pow(2, 38)` to get the correct URI address

### Level 2

The second challenge contains Caesar cipher. You can use "task2.py" to decode the cipher.

### Level 3

Task gives you two ways how to solve its:

* Using OCR (but itsn't possible because quality of text)

* Using programming to decode source text from the page

You can execute "task3.py" to clean up the garbage and to find the next segment of url.

### Level 4

The task is pretty simple. It makes us to fresh the mind of regular expressions. Please launch "task4.py" to find sequence on the page.

### Level 5

This task was very interesting for me. You should process pages recursively to find the next link segment.

I used the Requests python library (it's a standard de-facto for hi-level libraries to work with http-client)

My PC had been worked about 10 mintes to execute needed segment =)
